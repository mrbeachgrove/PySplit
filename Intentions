This project was originally started to make available a split timer software compatible with OBS for Mac users.
However the program should work for any OS with Python3 installed.

I am not really a programmer and everything is made with trial and error. Use the code as you please. 

Any tips on how to make the code clean and neat in the future are welcome.
